# Machine-Learning-Implementations

This repository includes (presently rough) machine learning implementations. This is an exercise purely for the purpose of 
learning how the algorithms work. Various unit tests unearthing the implementations can also be found.

Where possible, an attempt will be made to use these implementations in other uses (e.g. Kaggle)
